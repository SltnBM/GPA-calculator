# GPA Calculator CLI
A simple Python CLI tool to calculate GPA (IPK) based on course credits (SKS) and grades, with support for early exit via `Ctrl+C`.

## Features
- Input course name, SKS (credits), and grade (A, AB, B, BC, C, D, E)
- Weighted GPA calculation based on SKS
- GPA classification: Excellent / Very Good / Good / Fair / Poor
- Graceful early exit with `Ctrl+C` during data entry â€” shows partial summary and computes GPA so far
- Lightweight CLI, zero external dependencies

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
```bash
https://github.com/SltnBM/GPA-calculator.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd GPA-calculator
```
3. Run the script
```bash
python main.py
```
4. Follow prompts:
   - Enter number of courses
   - For each course: name, SKS (can be decimal), and grade
   - Press `Ctrl+C` at any time to stop early and still get the summary

## Grade Scale
| Grade | Weight |
|-------|--------|
| A     | 4.0    |
| AB    | 3.5    |
| B     | 3.0    |
| BC    | 2.5    |
| C     | 2.0    |
| D     | 1.0    |
| E     | 0.0    |

## Example Session
```bash
How many courses? 3

Course 1
Course name: Calculus
Number of credits (SKS): 3
Grade (A, AB, B, BC, C, D, E): A

Course 2
Course name: Algorithm
Number of credits (SKS): 4
Grade (A, AB, B, BC, C, D, E): B

Course 3
Course name: Database
Number of credits (SKS): 2
Grade (A, AB, B, BC, C, D, E): AB

--- Course Summary ---
Calculus (3.0 SKS) - Grade: A
Algorithm (4.0 SKS) - Grade: B
Database (2.0 SKS) - Grade: AB

Your GPA is: 3.35
GPA Category: Very Good
